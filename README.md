# CoC_BB_FarmingBot

- you need to install the Clash of Clans Windows Beta and open the Clash of Clans Page in the Google Play Beta app
- also make sure the builder base is selected and not the home village
- pre select a full PEKKA army
- just run the main.py and the bot will do the attacking for you, no further input needed
- troop placement and timing is randomized

- currently, the bot only works for 1080p and 1440p resolution.
